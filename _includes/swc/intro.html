  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

  The KAUST Visualization Lab is hosting an <em>Introduction to Python for Data Science</em> workshop. 
  Visualization lab staff will provide an introduction to Python for data science designed for 
  learners with little or no previous programming experience.
</p>
<p>
  Topics covered will include
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basics of programming in Python</li>
  <li>Basics of Python Data Science libraries including <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="http://www.numpy.org/ ">Numpy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></li>
  <li>Next steps for more advanced training in Python for data science.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This hands-on lesson is part of the <em>Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series</em> 
  being offered by KVL as part of our on-going efforts to build 
  capacity in core data science skills both at KAUST and within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). 
</p>
<p>
  The workshop curriculum largely follows the 
  <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/">curriculum</a> developed by 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>, a volunteer project dedicated to helping 
  researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research 
  computing skills.
</p>
<p>
  This is a live-coding based workshop and learners are expected to work along with the instructor using freely 
  available cloud resources provided by the <a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Binder</a> project.
